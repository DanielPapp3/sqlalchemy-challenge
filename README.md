# sqlalchemy-challenge

This repo contains the results of an analysis on a SQL Database provided by the instructors which contained information related to the weather in Hawaii in 2016 and 2017.

The original SQLite database file can be found by navigating to the "SurfsUp/Resources" folder located inside this repository.

The objective was to analyze the weather records from various weather stations in Hawaii in a Jupyter Notebook file and create a Flask app that allowed a user to retrieve that data using an API. Both the Jupyter Notebook (climate_starter.ipynb) and Flask app (app.py) files can be found in the "SurfsUp" folder within this repository.
